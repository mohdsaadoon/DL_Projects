 - The [Kuzushiji_MNIST_NN](https://github.com/mohdsaadoon/DL_Projects/blob/main/Kuzushiji_MNIST_NN.ipynb) notebook provides an in-depth overview of Neural Networks using TensorFlow. In this notebook, we train Neural Networks on the fascinating Japanese MNIST dataset, Kuzushiji-MNIST. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten Hiragana characters, presenting a captivating challenge for character recognition.

## Dataset Details

The Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset contains handwritten characters from the Hiragana script used in the Japanese writing system. The dataset's images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels, similar to the traditional MNIST dataset. The target variable consists of ten classes, each corresponding to a specific Hiragana character.

## Neural Network Training

Using the powerful TensorFlow library, we implement Neural Networks to recognize and classify the handwritten characters in the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset. We explore various architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques for accurate and reliable character recognition.
